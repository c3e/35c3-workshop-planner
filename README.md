# 35c3-workshop-planner
This is an expo.io app for mobile devices to plan your workshops at the 35c3 event in Leipzig


## Software to build this project

First you need node.js
* https://nodejs.org/en/download/

I recommend nvm to organise your Node version:
* https://github.com/creationix/nvm

Recommended package manager: yarn
* https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

This software is written in TypeScript. Install it global with:

``yarn global add typescript``

If you want to lint your code also install tslint: 

``yarn global add tslint``

To install the expo.io Clint run:

``yarn add global expo-cli@2.6.6``
(current Version 2.6.8 is buggy, so i use 2.6.6)

Now you are ready to install the dependencies:

``yarn install``

To start the app run:

``yarn start``
